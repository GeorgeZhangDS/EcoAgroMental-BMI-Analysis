    "Body Mass Index, or BMI, is a numerical metric that evaluates the connection between a person's weight and height. A high BMI can suggest excessive body fat. (1) BMI is commonly utilized as a screening tool to identify potential weight-related health problems. The purpose of this study is to look into the global impact of economic issues, food production, and mental health on BMI. The study will concentrate on the influence of GDP, wheat production, and depression on BMI in particular. We aim to provide insight to establish policies and strategies to address weight-related health issues on a worldwide basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are already a great number of articles on this topic. For instance, Egger, Swinburn, and Islam conducted a comparative analysis of BMI data and GDP levels across 175 developing countries. They found that although the GDP growth has significantly benefited the living standard of people in developing countries.Nevertheless, it also resulted in negative consequences such as overconsumption and to some extent lead to higher levels of BMI. (2) Morver, Giacco, Pepa, Luongo, and Riccardi reviewed 14 cross-sectional studies that mainly focus on the United States. They find a consistent negative correlation between higher consumption of whole grains especially wheat and the body mass index. (3)The relationship between BMI and mental health, specifically depression, has also been widely studied. In the article “Using Genetics to Understand the Causal Influence of Higher BMI on Depression”, researchers employed a Mendelian randomization approach to examine the relationship between BMI and the likelihood of developing depression.Their analysis included separate evaluations for the influence on men and women, and they discovered a strong relationship between higher BMI and increasing rates of depression. Their findings suggest that higher BMI, with or without its metabolic consequences, may have a causal role in the development of depression. (4)\n",
    "\n",
    "Previous research has found a significant correlation between health, economic variables, and mental well-being. However, the majority of the research publications described are largely concerned with regional levels. In contrast, the purpose of this study is to investigate the global-level link between GDP, wheat output, and depression on BMI. We aim to provide a comprehensive examination of the relationships between these aspects on a larger scale, taking a global viewpoint.\n"
